# Day 09: Memory Alignment & Coalescing

Optimizing memory accesses is crucial for high-performance CUDA applications. On Day 09, we explore **Memory Alignment & Coalescing**—techniques to ensure that global memory accesses are efficient. In this lesson, you will learn how coalesced memory accesses improve performance compared to non-coalesced (non-contiguous) patterns. We will benchmark both approaches in a kernel, discuss common pitfalls, and provide practical exercises and diagrams to help you grasp the concepts.

## 1. Overview
Global memory accesses in CUDA are most efficient when threads in a warp access contiguous memory addresses—a process known as **memory coalescing**. When threads access memory non-contiguously, memory transactions become inefficient, leading to a severe performance penalty. In this lesson, we will:
- Define memory alignment and coalescing.
- Explain how coalesced memory accesses improve throughput.
- Benchmark the performance difference between coalesced and non-coalesced memory accesses.
- Highlight common pitfalls and debugging strategies.

## 2. Memory Alignment & Coalescing: Concepts
### Memory Alignment
Memory alignment means that data is stored in memory at addresses that are multiples of the data size or cache line size. Proper alignment:
- **Ensures Efficient Access:** Aligned data is fetched in fewer memory transactions.
- **Reduces Overhead:** Misaligned accesses might require multiple memory transactions.

### Memory Coalescing
Memory coalescing occurs when threads in a warp (usually 32 threads) access contiguous memory addresses in a single transaction. Key points include:
- **Coalesced Access:** If the memory requests of a warp fall into one or a few contiguous blocks, the GPU can combine (coalesce) them into a single memory transaction.
- **Non-Coalesced Access:** When memory accesses are scattered, the GPU must perform multiple memory transactions, which degrades performance.

*Practical Impact:*  
Non-contiguous access patterns hurt performance significantly. Benchmarking these access patterns will demonstrate a stark difference in throughput.

---

## 3. Benchmarking Coalesced vs. Non-Coalesced Access
To illustrate the performance impact, we will compare two kernels:
- **Coalesced Kernel:** Threads access elements in contiguous order.
- **Non-Coalesced Kernel:** Threads access elements with a stride, causing scattered (non-contiguous) accesses.

### Coalesced Access Example
In a coalesced memory access scenario, thread `i` reads the element at index `i` of an array.  
**Access Pattern:**  
```
Thread 0 -> A[0]
Thread 1 -> A[1]
...
Thread 31 -> A[31]
```

### Non-Coalesced Access Example
In a non-coalesced access scenario, threads might access data with a stride larger than one, e.g., thread `i` accesses the element at index `i * stride`.  
**Access Pattern (stride = 2):**  
```
Thread 0 -> A[0]
Thread 1 -> A[2]
...
Thread 31 -> A[62]
```

## 4. Practical Exercise: Kernel Benchmarking
In this exercise, you will implement two kernels—one that exhibits coalesced memory access and one that does not. You will then measure and compare their performance.

### Code Example
```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Kernel with coalesced memory access
__global__ void coalescedKernel(const float *input, float *output, int N) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        // Simple operation: copy data
        output[idx] = input[idx] * 2.0f;
    }
}

// Kernel with non-coalesced memory access
__global__ void nonCoalescedKernel(const float *input, float *output, int N, int stride) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    int index = idx * stride;
    if (index < N) {
        // Simple operation: copy data
        output[index] = input[index] * 2.0f;
    }
}

int main() {
    int N = 1 << 20; // 1M elements
    size_t size = N * sizeof(float);
    cudaError_t err;

    // Allocate host memory
    float *h_input = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_output = (float*)malloc(size);

    // Initialize host array
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        h_input[i] = 1.0f;
    }

    // Allocate device memory
    float *d_input, *d_output;
    err = cudaMalloc((void**)&d_input, size);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) { fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err)); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }
    err = cudaMalloc((void**)&d_output, size);
    if (err != cudaSuccess) { fprintf(stderr, "Error: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err)); exit(EXIT_FAILURE); }

    // Copy input data to device
    cudaMemcpy(d_input, h_input, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Configure kernel execution
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    // Benchmark coalesced kernel
    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&stop);
    cudaEventRecord(start);
    coalescedKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_input, d_output, N);
    cudaEventRecord(stop);
    cudaEventSynchronize(stop);
    float millisecondsCoalesced = 0;
    cudaEventElapsedTime(&millisecondsCoalesced, start, stop);

    // Benchmark non-coalesced kernel (stride = 2)
    cudaEventRecord(start);
    nonCoalescedKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_input, d_output, N, 2);
    cudaEventRecord(stop);
    cudaEventSynchronize(stop);
    float millisecondsNonCoalesced = 0;
    cudaEventElapsedTime(&millisecondsNonCoalesced, start, stop);

    // Print benchmark results
    printf("Coalesced Kernel Time:    %f ms\n", millisecondsCoalesced);
    printf("Non-Coalesced Kernel Time: %f ms\n", millisecondsNonCoalesced);

    // Cleanup
    cudaFree(d_input);
    cudaFree(d_output);
    free(h_input);
    free(h_output);
    cudaEventDestroy(start);
    cudaEventDestroy(stop);

    return 0;
}
```

*Explanation:*
- Two kernels are implemented: one with coalesced accesses and one with non-coalesced accesses (using a stride).
- CUDA events are used to measure the execution time of each kernel.
- The performance difference will highlight the importance of memory coalescing.

## 5. Debugging Pitfalls and Best Practices
When optimizing memory accesses, be aware of these pitfalls:
1. **Non-Contiguous Access Patterns:**  
   - **Problem:** Non-coalesced memory accesses lead to multiple memory transactions.
   - **Solution:** Arrange data so that threads in a warp access contiguous memory.

2. **Improper Memory Alignment:**  
   - **Problem:** Misaligned data can cause inefficient memory transactions.
   - **Solution:** Ensure data structures are aligned to boundaries that match the GPU’s memory architecture (e.g., 128-byte alignment).

3. **Ignoring Error Checking:**  
   - **Problem:** Failing to check the return values of CUDA API calls can mask errors.
   - **Solution:** Use robust error checking after memory allocation, kernel launches, and memory copies.

4. **Overlooking Kernel Launch Configurations:**  
   - **Problem:** Incorrect block or grid dimensions can lead to poor performance.
   - **Solution:** Optimize kernel launch parameters (threads per block and blocks per grid) for your specific application.
